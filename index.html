                    <p id="aboutMe">Hi, I'm Dave. I've been on computers my whole life. Anthony, my brother jump-started my interest in computers when I was a little kid. As I got older I got into bigger games, and bigger ideas of what I could do with the computer. I learned so much about computers by causing problems, getting viruses, etc. My parents wouldn't buy me a new computer so I had to learn how to fix the problems and clean the computer. In my free time I like to hang out at the James River or surf the internet. Some of my favorite hobbies are kayaking, running, and video games. Luna, my dog, loves to go on runs with me when she can. Everyday I learn something new by meeting new people at my job or playing on the computer.</p>
